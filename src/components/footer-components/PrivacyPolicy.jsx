              <h1>Use of Cookies</h1>
              <p style={{ fontSize: "larger" }}>
                The Honest Home Hub website may use "cookies" to help you
                personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that
                is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot
                be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer.
                Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a
                web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. <br />
                <br />
                One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a
                convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is
                to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific
                page. For example, if you personalize Honest Home Hub pages, or
                register with Honest Home Hub site or services, a cookie helps
                Honest Home Hub to recall your specific information on
                subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your
                personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping
                addresses, and so on. When you return to the same Honest Home
                Hub website, the information you previously provided can be
                retrieved, so you can easily use the Honest Home Hub features
                that you customized. <br />
                <br />
                You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web
                browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually
                modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If
                you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully
                experience the interactive features of the Honest Home Hub
                services or websites you visit.
